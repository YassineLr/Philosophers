********************************* THREADS *********************************
Within a program, a Thread is a separate execution path. It is a 
lightweight process that the operating system can schedule and run concurrently 
with other threads. The operating system creates and manages threads, and they 
share the same memory and resources as the program that created them. This enables 
multiple threads to collaborate and work efficiently within a single program.

A thread is a single sequence stream within a process. Threads are also called 
lightweight processes as they possess some of the properties of processes. 
Each thread belongs to exactly one process. In an operating system that supports 
multithreading, the process can consist of many threads. 

**************************** Why Multi-Threading? ****************************
A thread is also known as a lightweight process. The idea is to achieve parallelism 
by dividing a process into multiple threads. For example, in a browser, multiple 
tabs can be different threads. MS Word uses multiple threads: one thread to format 
the text, another thread to process inputs, etc. More advantages of multithreading 
are discussed below.

Multithreading is a technique used in operating systems to improve the performance 
and responsiveness of computer systems. Multithreading allows multiple threads (i.e., lightweight processes) 
to share the same resources of a single process, such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

************************************* CPU *************************************

A processor (CPU) is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions 
that drive a computer. The CPU is seen as the main and most crucial integrated circuitry (IC) chip 
in a computer, as it is responsible for interpreting most of computers commands. CPUs will perform most 
basic arithmetic, logic and I/O operations, as well as allocate commands for other chips and 
components running in a computer.

*********************** The basic elements of a processor ***********************

 -> The arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which carries out arithmetic and logic operationson the operands in instructions. 
 -> The floating point unit (FPU), also known as a math coprocessor or numeric coprocessor, a specialized coprocessorthat 
    manipulates numbers more quickly than the basic microprocessor circuitry can.
 -> Registers, which hold instructions and other data. Registers supply operands to the ALU and store the results of operations.
 -> L1 and L2cache memory. Their inclusion in the CPU saves time compared to having to get data from random access memory (RAM).

***************************** CPU Operations *****************************

The four primary functions of a processor are fetch, decode, execute and write back.

 -> Fetch : is the operation which receives instructions from program memory from a systems RAM.
 -> Decode : is where the instruction is converted to understand which other parts of the CPU are 
    needed to continue the operation. This is performed by the instruction decoder
 -> Execute : is where the operation is performed. Each part of the CPU that is needed is activated 
    to carry out the instructions.

********************* How the processor scheduler works? *********************

            ********************* Definition *********************
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running 
process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating 
systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded 
process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

            ************** Categories of Scheduling **************
PCB = Process Control Block




******************************** Process Table and Process Control Block (PCB) ********************************
While creating a process the operating system performs several operations. To identify the processes, it assigns 
a process identification number (PID) to each process. As the operating system supports multi-programming, it needs 
to keep track of all the processes. For this task, the process control block (PCB) is used to track the process’s 
execution status. Each block of memory contains information about the process state, program counter, stack pointer, 
status of opened files, scheduling algorithms, etc. All this information is required and must be saved when the 
process is switched from one state to another. When the process makes a transition from one state to another, the 
operating system must update information in the process’s PCB. A process control block (PCB) contains information 
about the process, i.e. registers, quantum, priority, etc. The process table is an array of PCBs, that means logically 
contains a PCB for all of the current processes in the system.

-> Pointer – It is a stack pointer which is required to be saved when the process is switched from one state to another to retain the current position of the process.
-> Process state – It stores the respective state of the process.
-> Process number – Every process is assigned with a unique id known as process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.
-> Program counter – It stores the counter which contains the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.
-> Register – These are the CPU registers which includes: accumulator, base, registers and general purpose registers.
-> Memory limits – This field contains the information about memory management system used by operating system. This may include the page tables, segment tables etc.
-> Open files list – This information includes the list of files opened for a process.
